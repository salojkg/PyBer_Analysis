# Summary
We have drilled down our  analysis based on weekly revenue based on the city type for 4 months.Below mentined are our findings and recommendations to Pyber
- Urban areas lead in Driver Counts, Revenue and number of rides
- Pyber needs to conduct a research in alayzing the factors affecting the Average fare per ride & Average Fare per driver in Rural and subUrban areas. Right now there is a big difference in the Average Fare Per Driver & Average fare per ride of three cities.
- One of the insight we get from the analysis is that the Average Fare per ride is more in rural and suburban cities when compared to urban which may be one of the reason for revenue loss from these cities.
- The 4 months revenue analysis by cities shows that, Pyber ride sharing has wide acceptability in Urban areas. The suburban areas graphs throws light that there is demand for Pyber in the month of April , when companred to urban and suburban areas , where both showed decline in revenue.
