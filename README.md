## Based on Rides
Pyber ridesharing is more popular in urban areas when compared to Suburban and rural areas. One of the major reason for this is because the population in urban areas and the number of people commuting is more compared to suburban and rural areas.

# Summary
We have drilled down our  analysis based on weekly revenue based on the city type for 4 months.Below mentined are our findings and recommendations to Pyber
- Urban areas lead in Driver Counts, Revenue and number of rides
- Pyber needs to conduct a research in analyzing the factors affecting the Average fare per ride & Average Fare per driver in Rural and subUrban areas. Right now there is a big difference in the Average Fare Per Driver & Average fare per ride of three city types.
- One of the insight we get from the analysis is that the Average Fare per ride is more in rural and suburban cities when compared to urban which may be one of the reason for revenue loss from these areas.
- The 4 months revenue analysis by cities shows that, Pyber ride sharing has wide acceptability in Urban areas. The suburban areas graphs throws light that there is demand for Pyber in the month of April , when companred to urban and rural areas , where both showed decline in revenue.
